This is the README for porting LULESH to LAIK


Building
========

Clone with "git clone --recurse ..." to also clone LAIK as submodule in subdirectory "laik/".
You also can use an existing LAIK installation by setting LAIK_ROOT when compiling LULESH.

Then compile LAIK:

    cd laik
    ./configure
    make
    
Finally build LULESH:

    make
