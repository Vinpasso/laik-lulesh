first we target the partitioning of the domain

we can ignore lulesh_tuple.h file
as it is not used in compilation
this file can be used as a reference
for for porting the data structures

in order to port the lulesh first we need to deal with the partitioning
of the domain. at the moment the MPI code uses a domin decomposition scheme
in function InitMeshDecomp. 
this function assigns the location of the

SetupElementConnectivities is for defining the local connectirvity of the elements

I have written a partitioner for the elements to exclusively partition them now 
I modify it to get the right partitioner

we have implemented the halo partitioner and it works with different number of offsets

next we have to implement the partitioner for the nodes
